# MathWithGestures

## How to run:
1. First all the ``dependencies.``
2. Run by: ``python -m streamlit run main.py``

## Here’s a brief rundown of how it works:
• 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Using the powerful combination of the cvzone and OpenCV (cv2) libraries, the application tracks hand gestures in real-time.

• 𝐆𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The app detects specific hand gestures that represent different mathematical operations.

• 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐯𝐚𝐬 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: By leveraging a virtual canvas, the application processes these gestures to understand and display the math problem.

• 𝐀𝐈 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The Google Gemini 1.5 Flash model then steps in to interpret the gesture-based problem and generates the solution.
